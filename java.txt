HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript are the languages that run the web.

HTML is for adding meaning to raw content by marking it up.
CSS is for formatting that marked up content.
JavaScript is for making that content and formatting interactive.

There are a ton of other things you will have to learn to actually make a web, like:
 
Organizing HTML into reusable templates
Standing up a web server
Moving files from your local computer to your web server
Reverting to a previous version when you screw something up
Pointing a domain name at your server
